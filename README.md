# Reset-Users-Password
My first attempt of creating an API that allows the admin to reset a user's application password. I upoloded as much of the npm installs into the .json file in order to generate the API as my code is supported by webpack v4 and not v5 which why I created webconfig.js to compensate for npm installs.
